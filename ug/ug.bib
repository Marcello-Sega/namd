% NOTES:	1) see top of group.bib for journal abbreviations.
%		2) article keyword should be of the form AAAANN, where
%		   AAAA = first four characters of first author, in all-caps
%		   NN = last two digits of year published, i.e. 94
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% New note: I am moving all bib entries here, so we don't need to read
% other bibs.  This reduces duplicate definitions.  But we then need
% to put all abbreviations here as well.
